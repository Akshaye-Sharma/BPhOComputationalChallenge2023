# Solar System Orbits and Animations

*A BPhO Computational Physics Challenge 2023 Project*

This repository contains Python scripts developed as part of my entry for the British Physics Olympiad (BPhO) Computational Physics Challenge 2023, 
where I was awarded a **Silver** medal. The project visualizes and animates the orbits of planets in our solar system using Matplotlib and NumPy.

## Features

* 2D static plots of inner and outer planets' elliptical orbits.
* 2D animation of inner planets orbiting the Sun.
* 3D animation of outer planets with orbital tilt.
* Numerical integration plot showing orbital time vs. angle using Simpson’s method.
* Spirograph plots combining orbits of two planets to generate beautiful, dynamic patterns.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* `matplotlib` library.
* `numpy` library.

You can install these with:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
```
## Usage

Run any of the scripts to generate plots or animations:

* `kepler_third_law.py` - 2d graph plot illustrating Kepler's III law.
* `inner_planets_plot.py` — static 2D plot of inner planets.
* `outer_planets_plot.py` — static 2D plot of outer planets.
* `inner_planets_animation.py` — 2D animated orbits of inner planets.
* `outer_planets_3d_animation.py` — 3D animated orbits of outer planets.
* `orbit_time_simpson.py` — plot orbital time vs angle using Simpson's integration.
* `spirograph.py` — generates spirograph patterns from two chosen planets’ orbits.
